Its an optimization over plain recursion

the idea is to reuse the solution of sub problems

1) Memoization (Top down)
2) Tabulation (Bottom up)

Applications
1) Bellman Fors Algorithm
2) Floyd warshall Algorithm
3) Diff Utility
4) Search closed words (Edit distamnce)
5) Resource Allocation (0-1 knapsack)

// tabulation is generally faster than memoization.
